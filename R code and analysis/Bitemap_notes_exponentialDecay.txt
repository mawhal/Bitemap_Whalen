## NOTES WHEN RUNNING MODELS FOR EACH HABITAT IN EACH COUNTRY
Generally good fit. More sensible in most cases than binomial model on proportions. The data really are count data in the end...

In most cases where model point predictions deviate from data, the predation rate is understimated.
Exceptions to above: 
* Texas  - mean rate looks pretty good, but tons of variation in the data
* Brazil - Rate of prey decrease is not negative because in some assays 30 units were installed and in others 25 were installed
	   (zero predation in 25 unit assays)


## NOTES WHEN RUNNING MODELS FOR EACH ASSAY IN EACH HABITAT IN EACH COUNTRY
Generally great fit. Obviously, standard errors will be very high for many models, but as estimates of predation RATE they work

A few cases with zero rate (this is good for the model to pick up, 
but should note in paper that zero does not mean no predation at a site, or that predation is unimportant)

A few cases where prediction does not come close to 25 at hour 0, all underestimations:
* USA (NC), USA (NC2) USA (TX), USA (VA)  - odd that these are all US East Coast sites
This happens where this is a lot of predation after one hour...might need to add more zeros
--padding with zeros helps pull the start of the line up to 25, but slope is still grossly underestimated

Australia (VIC): several underestimates of predation in seagrass. Not sure what to do about this




## THOUGHTS ABOUT PATTERNS IN DATA
Predator hunting mode differences across sites and how this interacts with habitat cover. 
Does this explain why some sites have higher predation in unvegetated or in seagrass.
